# Diabetic-using_Insulin-BMI

This code is made using logistic regression targets weather a person is diabetic or not using the BMI and Insulin of a person

I have added the classification report as well accuracy is 65 percent .... My advise is to not use logistic regression 

for Output if you the output is 1 the person is diabetic and if 0 then not diabetic
